# Majiang | 麻将

## Javascript game

The classical Chinese game majiang (麻将) or «mahjong» is here being built as a single player game against three computer players, using Javascript and SASS. Currently there is nothing but the basic board setup using CSS rules, and a basic Javascript navigation framework. Game logic is being added.

Game will eventually be playable at [Github pages](https://dougherty-dev.github.io/Majiang/), check back in a few weeks.
