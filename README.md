# Majiang | 麻将

## Javascript game

The classical Chinese game Majiang (麻将) is here implemented as a single player game against three computer players, using Javascript and SASS. Play it [here](https://dougherty-dev.github.io/Majiang/).

### Game hints

- Human player is seated at the bottom position of the table.
- **Double-click** to discard a tile.
- Click on human player’s seat wind icon to choose another avatar.
- Sort tiles on hand by **dragging** for custom organization. Restore automatic ordering by clicking the sort icon ☰ above the seat wind icon.
- 8 *fan* (番) needed to win. If you have a crappy hand, meld whatever you can and hope for a single or other wait.
- You are supposed to deal with the hand dealt to you, but there’s always the escape key.
- You **can** play it on your phone, if you have good eyes and precision touch…

### Miscellaneous

New to Majiang? Just tag along and see what’s happening, then read the rules (conforming to Standard Majiang, or 国标麻将 *guoji majiang*). You’ll quickly pick up the basics. The hard part is recognizing the winning combinations.

Bots are currently not very intelligent, but nevertheless employ a simple and surprisingly efficient strategy. They will probably beat you, inless you’re lucky.
